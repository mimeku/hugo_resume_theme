# Modify the home page

## section linked to the menu
The sections in your `/home` folder can be renamed to anything you like. Just remember to update your main menu in `config/_default/menus.yaml` if you have a link to the widget instance.

## position order

The order that the homepage widgets are displayed in is defined by the `weight` parameter in each of the files in the `content/home` directory.
